<h1 align="center">Screenie (Netflix clone)</h1>
This is a clone of Netflix website built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It's not a replica, and it doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. it's a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch. It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and movie player.
